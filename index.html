    <p> Ladies and gentlemen, today we’ve gathered to celebrate not just our friendship, but also our shared love for food—particularly spicy food! If you see someone sweating, don't worry, it’s just our natural way of saying “I love you.” 
        So, grab a napkin, and let’s enjoy this fiery feast together!</p>
